    <h2>Iron Man</h2>
      <p>Mr. Anthony Edward  "Tony" Stark, most commonly known to the world as Iron Man, has passed away from carrying too many stones and snapping his fingers on April 26th, 2019.  'Billionaire, playboy, philanthropist' known for foul mouth and obnoxious nature, Tony Stark ruined many lives including but not limited to Obadiah Stone and Justin Hammer but will forever be remembered for his loving hate. As the beloved creator of Optimus Prime, which he created as a mere child, Stark has proved that intelligence always prevails over brute strength only to be proven false in the end. Lesson: Self-preservation never wins. Love you 3000.</p>

    <h2>Captain America</h2>
      <p>Mr. Steve Rogers, aka Captain "Cap" America, dies of declining years and a weak heart. To run from his problems and grief after best friend Tony dies, Cap, supposed leader of the Avengers, travels back to twentieth century (dark ages) to dance with his girlfriend, or future wife. Born in the dark ages, Captain America was a humble, strong-minded  man willing to take a bullet for his friends in the war, but with the aid of a peculiar drug, Rogers was turned into a egotistical, weak-minded man. With his incredibly good looks and persuasive voice, Rogers manipulated the hearts and minds of the American people against their will. Although Cap always lost the title "Sexiest Man Alive" to a Rock or obese Thor, he will forever be remembered as Uncle Sam's sidekick.</p>

   <h2>Black Widow</h2>
      <p>Ms. Natalia Alianova "Natasha" Romanova, known the world as Black Widow, died sacrificing herself for a red stone. A claimed feminist identifiable by her extremely tight fitting, revealing clothing is part of the founding Avengers squad, but only gets her own backstory after her death. There is little known about Black Widow except that she was evidently a assassin ballerina. Even though she was a classic Russian beauty, she never quite captures the heart of her crush and dies lonely. She will always be remembered for her strong poise and striking red hair. </p>
  </li>

 <li>
   <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Mr. Vision, a refined version of J.A.R.V.I.S createad by none other than Tony Stark, was created as a mistake but killed on purpose. In a battle between the meek Avengers and Thanos, Thanos finds Wanda, Vision's love, destroying the stone stuck on his forehead.  After the stone is destroyed, Thanos simply uses the green stone to move time backwards and pulls the stone off of Vision's forehead, and he instantly shut down. The mind-blowing Vision was known for his abnormally red body and his inability to fend for himself. He will forever be remembered as the robot who caused the universe population to be cut into exactly half.</p>
